            <h2>The Historical Constitutions of India and Europe</h2>
            <p class="blog-meta">Posted on July 16, 2024 by Akarsh</p>
            <p>I like to think of India as a continent , which is only masquerading as a nation ; what were the causes that led to the consolidation of such 
                a fantastic idea that such a massive and diverse landmass could ever be one nation ? In that query of ours , we find answers by an objective comparison to an actual continent which is civilizationally comparable to India : Europe <br>

                We begin first by investigating the historical reasons for the almost eterally lasting national disunity and animosity in Europe and the consequent lack of a cohesive European identity which trumps over those national identities. <br>
                
                We will then go on to understand why such a tendency, if it ever arose in India, will eventually subsumed into the whole national character of a Hindu/Indian identity. 
            </p>
            <h3>Genesis of a State</h3>
            <p>The fundamental reason for the rise of organized government was the preservation and protection of acquired resources, and the desire to enhance the mechanisms for creation of resources. In face of an acute shortage of resources in the ancient era (and a complete inability to efficiency extract the maximum output from the said resources), a need was felt to develop systems to manage the competition for resources. 
                This basic instinct led to a social contract between the masses and what gradually emerged to be the ruling class : the latter was granted privileges to collect taxes and maintain an army to carry out the functions as illustrated above. 
                In the ancient era, this competition for resources was intense and trade as an institution was yet to mature , the reasons being lack of currency, uniform weights and measures, and inefficient logistics, amongst the others. In such a circumstance,
                this competition for resources could only be settled by the means of interaction between the ruling agents of the state : these interactions are what we now come to see as <b><i>politics</i></b>
            </p>

            <p> The conclusion, which is anyway fairly obvious, is that politics is, in plain terms, the art of acquiring resources as a leader for one's folk and kin. When politics fails, wars are waged. There is a second fundamental notion to a state, though. </p>
            <p> Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyaya, in his short but insightful essay , "The Origin of Religion", tells us that religion emerged out of man's fascination with the nature of beings ; whilst sleeping, a man possesses life but no consciousness ; at the same time it is possible to distinguish between a dead man and a man with life ; the primitive, ancient man, then questions whether consciousness would exist without life ? 
                <br> The ancient man observes his surroundings and finds that trees, plants, and flowers possess life ; do they possess consciousness ? Hills, mountains, and rivers do not seem living, but they turn enraged and cause great harm once in a while ! The ancient man observes how unpleasant attitudes can lead to anger in a person and how appeasement can calm those angers. 
                And hence, he conflates this idea in order to appease the mountains, hills, rivers, and the rest of nature's divinities. <br>

                Chattopadhyaya was extremely lucid in this articulation : we can only further imagine how religious communities would develop as frateral ties would develop around being part of the same natural landscape. Man has found the communal spirit in face of shared struggles  ; 
                in these circumstances, customs and rituals gradually developed , and religion was born. 
                <br> We need to consider the fact that religion subsumed culture in its entirety in most of the earlier period ; it was only later that secular culture developed. In conclusion, we see that hordes of men consolidated into civilized groups under two objectivities in the ancient period : politics and religion. Those are, then, the two fundamental aspects of consolidation of a state, or as Hindus would call it, <b><i>Rajya</i></b>
            </p>
            <h3>Nature of Politics in Europe</h3>
            <p>We have established how politics ultimately originated in the struggle for resources. The European continent finds itself deplete of resources  and subject to harsh weather conditions. The most fertile lands lie in Eastern Europe (no doubt that part of the world gave us two World Wars) but they still are insufficient to meet the needs of the contient. In Europe did man find the competition for resources the most intense and cynical ; a defeat in battle did not mean migration and living to fight another day 
                , <i>as it did in India </i>, it instead sounded the death knell of the community the army represented. <i>Compromise</i> as a concept was incredibly difficult since resources were scarce. How would political negotiations work if the scope for compromise itself remains limited ? In such a circumstance, a <i>balance of power</i> needed to be maintain betwen different states, an idea which is extremely fundamental to understanding the politics of Europe. We first see observe this pattern in Ancient Greece, with only short periods of consolidation. 
            The Roman Empire at its greatest extent consisted of Egypt and Asia Minor , South and West of Europe ; it still could not consolidate the vast Central and Eastern ends. The Empire still remained in tumult, faced with tumult and rebellions.
        Post Roman decline, Europe fragmented into hundreds of petty kingdoms and principalities ; the consolidation of which took place only in the 19 century ! Funnily enough, Europe has only seen unity under Napoleon and Hitler in the modern era. In conclusion, political unity is impossible in Eurpoe. And  
    that is because of the inherent balance of power that birthed in the European psyche as a consequence of their ancient struggles. In Europe, the prospect of a centralized European Empire has always sparked the greatest of fears ; the monopolization of a scarcity is natural to spark fears , none so better exemplified than by the British policy to always battle against the strongest European power in order to check the latter's growth ! The entire European political scene is dictated by this reality that Europe cannot be a self-sufficient continent and it <i>must</i>, therefore, seek to expand its horizons. Colonialism, too, can be understood under this framework. </p>
<h3> How Culture and Politics Interact</h3>
<p> We saw earlier how politics and religion, the latter which we may conflate with culture for our period, form the two critical elements for rise of a state. How do cultural interactions take place ? I propose that there are three stages of cultural interactions.
    <br> First is cultural exchanges, second is cultural appreciation, and the last is that of cultural unity. Each can be uniquely identified. One might argue that North India and Pakistan are connected significantly in terms of cultural exchanges but there is very little appreciation between the two, apart from music and cinema. 
    United States and France, for example, not only exchange popular memes and ideas but there is a great deal of mutual appreciation and respect ; however the US is a distinctly English-speaking nation whose culture will always appear distinct from the French culture  ; American and British culture, on the other hand, derive significantly from the same Anglo-Saxon root and it might be 
    almost impossible for an uninformed observer to distinguish them. <br>
    Cultural exchanges are inevitable and can never really be eliminated ; for the second stage to be achieved , political animosity needs to be minimized , and only then the third stage can then be achieved. <br>
    Once cultural unity between two states is achieved, their <i>political unity</i> becomes easier to achieve. The purpose of political unity is to safeguard resources <i>for the popular community in that state</i> ; those communal boundaries are drawn 
    courtesy culture , and once cultural boundaries blur and a unification of ideas takes place , the community expands to include multiple groups into one , which is then easy to constitute into a new state. 
    <br>
    Since the nature of Europe mandates permanent political animosity, a cultural unification is impossible to achieve , and therefore Europe can never unite. 
    <br> Leave alone a cultural unification leading to political unification ; even cultural unification has never been lasting. Europe blossomed in the early spring of Hellenic philosophy, which was followed by the heydays of Greco-Roman ideas. 
    This was swiftly crushed by the rise of Christianity ; Europe united under faith for a considerable period of time in face of the threat from Islam. However, once that ended, Christianity split into hard boundaries of Protestantism and Catholicism; not to mention the Orthodox form. 
    Christianity was soon overrun by the notions of Capitalism and Socialism courtesy the ascendancy of economics due to the Industrial Revolution , and now in face of industrial decline finds itself passionately devoted to Liberalism. 
    <br> Political rivalries are in the very constitution of Europe ; one can be certain that no such force shall arise that shall pacify into a single mass the nations of Europe ; if it ever did arise, it shall be defeated by Europeans themselves.
</p>      
<h3> On India</h3>
<p> India on the other hand, finds itself a bounty of nature. An Indian can be forgiven for taking the proportions of India for granted. Take the Gangetic plains for example.
    <br> The Gangetic plains are home to almost 800 million people , who constitute almost 10% of the global population. We are merely talking about the stretch from Haryana to what is now Bangladesh.
India is <i>massive</i>. And bountiful. The Gangetic plains are the most fertile stretch of land in the world. Lush green forests in the centre, and a long necklace as a coastline. India constitutes a world in itself. 
<br> A struggle for resources , in the ancient period, could never be intense. Political rivalries could never amount to questions of life and death. When King Sudas of the Bharat tribe, under Sage Vashishtha's tutelage, won the Battle of the Ten Kings on banks of the Ravi river and established the state named Bharat, 
he did not have to eliminate his enemies forever. The Vedas tell us that there existed literature <i>before</i> them ; and they are a compilation of the best ideas. Each Veda contains ideas from multiple rishis , belonging to multiple families and tribes. The scope for compromise was exponentially manifolded by the riches of Indian geography and the early Indians took great advantage of that. 
The minimal political animosities laid ground for cultural unity to emerge which it did in form of the Vedic civilization. The Aryans certainly did not inhabit the entire subcontinent at first and they had to convince the rest of the country to be a part of the Aryan nation. 
In India, therefore, cultural unity was achieved in a very early period , which lasts to this day. 
<br> Another institution which further developed this cultural unity was the caste system. This is almost a blasphemous subject to speak on , but one needs to be patient in dealing with this. 
Europe scrambled for resources ; the caste system on the other hand provided for birth-based employment to every man. The caste-system, in its true spirit, provided for a social structure providing for security of resources for every individual, 
while also providing for easy integration of non-Aryan groups into the Vedic fold. A tribe would enter the Vedic fold only once sufficient cultural unity was reached, and the caste system further provided for livelihood security as one simply had to join the caste as per one's profession ; and his children would forever continue to bear the fruits of that profession, without interference from the other castes.
<br> Indeed, this system had fundamentally collapsed by the 7th century CE, courtesy foreign invasions, influx of migrants,climate change, and rapid economic decline. In difficult circumstances, social evils rose which last to this day. Further, 
the industrial revolution completely altered the concept of livelihood in the modern world, since the 18th century, which has further complicated matters. But that is a tale for another day. The idea is, the caste system was a unique force of the Aryan nation which laid grounds for seamless integration in the ancient era. The cultural idea of India lives to this day.

<h3>Contrasting India and Europe </h3>
<p> In Europe, in the dryness of nature, man sought to create beauty on the exterior. This is key to understanding why European sense of arts and aesthetics dominates public imagination. In India, on the other hand, man found himself overwhelmed by the monstrosities of nature. 
    The beauty and scale was immense on the outside and that prompted questions and puzzles within the mind. No matter what he did , he could never match the scale of what he described as God's creation on Earth. In Europe man sought to reach divinity by sculpture, and painting ; in India man found 
    solace in deep philosophy. In Europe man thought of knowledge as power ; in India man thought of knowledge as freedom from the world. In Europe man sought to multiply by machine what he had little; in India man struggled with the constant urge to retire into meditation and peace, for he felt he had plenty. 
    In Europe , man imagined God lording a Kingdom of Heaven ; in India man imagined the <i>Purusha</i> to be formless , and us as fragments of it, pushed to this life and action only by the forces of <i>Prakriti</i>. 
    <br> There are great merits and demerits in both of these paths, and in conclusion, as Burke would have done by going with tradition and prejudice, I shall not question the Noble Arya , Gautama Buddha, and see reason in the Middle Path.
